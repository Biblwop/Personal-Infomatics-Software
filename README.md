appropriate requirements gathering techniques.
Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2

3. Background Research

### Functional Requirements

5. Viewing and Collecting Tracking Data
  - #### Initial Requirements:
  - [ ] 5.1 Store data on user activity relevant to the chosen PI
concept (see Section 3 ‘Tracking Data’ of specification for more detail).
Dependencies: 3
  - [ ] 5.2 Allow the user to access tracking data that is stored.
  - [ ] 5.3 Permit the user to manually enter any tracking data which
can not be obtained automatically from a tracking device or
service (e.g. allowing the user to enter the number of cups
of coffee consumed each day, or to enter a rating that
represents their mood for the day).
  - #### Additional Requirements:

6. Identifying Trends and Relationships in PI Data
  - #### Initial Requirements:
  - [ ] 6.1 Permit a user to compare their data over time (e.g. to see
if they have walked 5% more each day for the last n days,
or if their diet is regularly less vegetable-intensive on a
Monday). 
  - [ ] 6.2 Permit a user to compare different kinds of PI data within
a fixed period of time (e.g. to find out if changes in their
mood have followed changes in their diet over the last 14
days).
  - #### Additional Requirements:

7. Goals and Achievements
  - #### Initial Requirements:
  - [ ] 7.1 Permit a user to manage targets (goals) for a tracked
activity.
  - [ ] 7.2 Permit a user to set a daily or weekly goal value for a
particular data variable (e.g. Steps Goal >= 10000,
Productivity Goal >= 60%, Cups of Coffee Goal <= 2).
  - [ ] 7.3 Permit a user to update or change a goal.
  - [ ] 7.4 Incorporate a feature to motivate the user to achieve their
goals (e.g. scoring points, receiving trophies/ badges,
competing with other users)
  - #### Additional Requirements:
