This folder contains meetings which should be kept from every meeting. Attendance is recorded for each meeting as a metric for tracking contribtutions to go towards the Group Contribution form. In advance of a meeting, a list of topics should be created where anyone can add topics that should be discussed at the next meeting. Then during a meeting, what is discussed relating to each of these topics should be noted under each topic. Any other information discussed during the meeting can be added under the notes section. Additionally, the date and location of the next meeting should be recorded beforehand in the file for the next meeting.
