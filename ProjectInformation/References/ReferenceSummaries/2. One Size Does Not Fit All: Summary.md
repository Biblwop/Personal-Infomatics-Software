# Reference 1. One Size Does Not Fit All: Applying the Transtheoretical Model to Energy Feedback Technology Design

A paper about people are motivated differently, in the context of motivating sustainable energy usage behaviours.

#### One approach to motivation is providing real-time, continuous feedback
  - Feedback can be presented in different ways, e.g.:
    - Raw (energy) use
    - Personal cost
    - Environmental impact
  - But this approach is limited as they provide the same feedback to differently motivated individuals, at different stages of readiness, willingness and ableness to change. 
  - Unless the user is already motivated, feedback only informs but doesn't necessarily motivate action.

#### Transtheoretical model:
Intentional behavior change occurs as a process:
  1. Unaware  or unwilling
  2. Acknowledging the problem
  3. Considering the possibility of change
  4. Preparing to make the change
  5. Taking action
  6. Maintaining desired behaviour over time
