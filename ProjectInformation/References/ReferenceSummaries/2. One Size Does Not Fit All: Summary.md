# Reference 1. One Size Does Not Fit All: Applying the Transtheoretical Model to Energy Feedback Technology Design

A paper about people are motivated differently, in the context of motivating sustainable energy usage behaviours through technology.

## Key Relevant Takeaways:
  - Information alone rarely motivates action
  - Information should change over time to match with the individuals deepening knowledge to sustain a behavior change

#### One approach to motivation is providing real-time, continuous feedback
  - Feedback can be presented in different ways, e.g.:
    - Raw data
    - Personal cost
    - Environmental impact
  - But this approach is limited as they provide the same feedback to differently motivated individuals, at different stages of readiness, willingness and ableness to change. 
  - Unless the user is already motivated, feedback only informs but doesn't necessarily motivate action.

#### Transtheoretical model (stages of change):
Intentional behavior change occurs as a process:
  1. *Precontemplation* (Unaware or unwilling)
  2. *Contemplation* (Acknowledging behaviour is a problem, open to information, but may be far from making an actual commitment)
  3. *Preparation* (Aims to develop and commit to a plan)
  5. *Action* (Overtly modifying behaviour)
  6. *Maintenance, Relapse, Recycling* (Sustain behavior change)

#### Durability of behaviour change 
Durability = behavior that is self sustaining without the need for repeated interventions. To achieve this, intrinsically motivated behaviour is ideal:
  - Intrisic motivation: Doing an activity for its inherent satisfactions rather than for some seperable consequence

#### Commonly-used motivation techniques

  - Information model
    - Provides information to a problem; why it is a problem, and action steps to solve the problem
  - Positive reinforcement
    - Response is followed by the addition of a reinforcing stimulus
    - Increases likelihood that response will be repeated in similar situations.
  - Elaboration Likelihood Model
    - Proposes two routes of cognitive processing
      1. Logic, rationale, and quality of the argument
      2. Emotional persuasion, influenced by factors unrelated to the argument's validity

### Information, Rational-Economic and Attitude Models:
  - Provide complex feedback visualizations and trends over days to months
  - Also action steps to improve behavior <br>
But limitations:
  1. **Information alone rarely motivates action**
  2. Humans have a psychological tendency to avoid non-supportive information, and may discount information that contradicts their current behaviors <br>
This model can be very effective in the *preparation* and *action* stages. Also can be effective in the *maintenance* stage if the **information changes over time to match with the individuals deepening knowledge**.
